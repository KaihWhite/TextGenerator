The first part of the assingment went pretty smoothly. I understood the concept and was able to implement it without any problems, and have it work correctly. I was honestly quite surprised, I would have though it more difficult for me as I have always admired Machine Learning, but been a bit aprehensive to try anything myself. After this experience, I am for sure going to try some other Machine learning algorithms and see if I can get them working. I did have a bit more trouble on the word part, but it wasn't because of the concept. In fact, my code from the character part and word part is fairly similar because I thought I had to write the initalize and generate functions to be able to work with both characters and strings. If you look, I used the same structure for the code, with the only differences being how I handled the text to parse the characters vs. parsing the words. The trouble I had with words was actually fairly trivial. I was inputing strings into the map that had spaces, then trying to access that key in the map with the same string without the spaces. I first was getting a werid arithemtic error and by using cout I was able to see it was because the key I was trying to access had a vector of size 0 instead of 1, and so it was throwing the error from me trying to mod a number by 0. Once I realised it was just that the map wasn't inserting elements consistently with how I was accessig them, I just added a space to all insterted elements at the end and made sure to access elements with a space added at the end. After this it worked like charm in the higher orders. I forgot to mention, order of 1 always worked for words, it was the higher orders that gave me issues due to the extra/missing spaces.

I really liked this assignment. Working on algorithms that seem difficult at the surface level is definitely daunting, but once I broke the problem into bite sized pieces I realised it wasn't too bad. I got quite enthusiastic about the fact that this was even an assignment for me because it gave the confidence that I could complete it. This is partly why I think I did it so fast, I got excited and just barreled through.

I spent about 5 hours on this assignment.
